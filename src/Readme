Hello,

Thanks for evaluating the code.

Following are some guidelines which would be helpful in the process :-
1. Environment dependency :-
    1.1 Junit - junit-4.10.jar
    1.2 Selenium - selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar
    1.3 Firefox Driver - geckodriver-v0.23.0
    1.4 OS - Ubuntu 16.04
    1.5 Firefox Browser - FF 46.0.1
    1.6 IDE - IntelliJ IDEA


2. I have tried to focus on all the possible testcases which would be testable with different datasets.

3. Testcases are written in the test functions with testdata.

4. Geckodriver is set in the system property in Setup method. If the code doesn't run then please download the geckodriver and mention the path of it in //System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "/home/local/CORVIL/kkislay/Downloads/geckodriver");

5. As per my observation, if the tests are failing due to not finding addresses xPath, please run the test again.

6.
